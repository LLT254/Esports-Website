      <p>Luis Rubio Pd. 3 Why that game? I decided to play smash bros because I’m ok at it and it seemed that someone there was getting on but didnt have a duo, after which someone else wanted to join so we just did 1v1v1. That game can be fun to play because there is a very clear skill reward gap to it, and its competitive presence is pretty strong given smash games have been running for decades now. The game belongs in the fighting game genre, given the traditional tournament rules dictate you have 3 stocks first one to lose them is the loser. What makes this game unique is the dozens of characters that are in it and how each one has a specific niche to it, so although 2 characters may be very alike their playstyles might fit a person differently. &nbsp; </p>
