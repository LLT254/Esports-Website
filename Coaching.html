    <p class="text_column"> Grenades can be incredibly useful in certain scenarios, but knowing how and when to use them makes all the difference. They function as a double edge sword, by taking up an inventory slot you're going to have to cut down on heals in order to make space for grenades, 1-2 should be what you try to fit in. It's also easy to feel like you have to empty all your grenades in order to do some damage (especially because the game cycles to your next grenade), using them accordingly is all about placement.  
</p>
    <p class="text_column">Final ring interactions can seem incredibly confusing at first, especially when there are 1-2 squads left and you don't know what to do. Final ring is all about timing, knowing when you should or shouldn't move, when to third-party (fire against a team right after they finished fighting to catch them off guard), or when to rotate. There are 2 different ways the ring closes there are cone closing or even closings. Cone closings means the ring is only closing in on one side like a cone, even closings means all sides of the ring are closing in at once. Identifying how the ring is closing is crucial in knowing when you should or shouldn't move. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Tap strafing requires a unique key bind layout which is adding a second bind to the forwards key. By adding scroll wheel up to the second bind, you'll be able to preform multiple forwards inputs in quick succession, this movement allows you to make 180 degree turns instantly whilst maintaining your momentum. This is especially useful when having to dodge and weave out of your opponents gunfire. *This is only capable on PC but is still useful to know if you're playing on controller to know when to counter it.. </p>

<p>This is Octanes ultimate it has a recharge time of 1.5 minutes (very low) meaning you can use it in many different ways; moving around a flat area quickly, pushing a team after they just finished a fight, gain high ground. Because of the low recharge times don't be afraid to use it. </p>

      <h3>Octane Stim</h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TCd59WnYs">Link to Octane Stim Clip</a>
<p>Octane stim functions as a double edge sword, because of the 20 health loss it can turn you into a glass cannon. However, stimming opens the door to a multitude of movement capabilities that more than make up for it.. </p>
