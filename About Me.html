    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">One of the first games I played was Minecraft, which was nearly 8 years ago. Being able to play with my friend Gabriel every time I visited his home helped me see how much I loved video games.
 </p>
    <p class="text_column">After becoming obsessed with video games, my younger brother also picked up. Our sibling rivalry has never been the same since. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Now that gaming has become a real hobby in my life, my spending on video games has increased. Paying for my own equipment also helped me learn to value what I have and allowed me to buy my brother what I would've dreamed of when I was younger.  </p>
